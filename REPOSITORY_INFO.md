## About Section (for GitHub):
This repository contains a complete pipeline for sign language detection and recognition using machine learning. It uses MediaPipe for hand tracking and TensorFlow/Keras for gesture classification. The system supports both single-handed and two-handed gestures, featuring data collection, preprocessing, model training, and real-time recognition components.

Key features:
- Real-time hand gesture recognition using webcam
- Support for both single-handed and two-handed signs
- Comprehensive data collection and preprocessing tools
- Temporal smoothing for stable recognition
- Sequence detection for multi-gesture signs
- Highly customizable for different gesture vocabularies
