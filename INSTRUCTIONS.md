# GitHub Upload Instructions

Follow these steps to complete uploading this project to GitHub:

1. **Create a New Repository on GitHub.com**
   - Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com)
   - Log in to your account
   - Click the "+" icon in the top right and select "New repository"
   - Name the repository: `sign-language-detection-ml`
   - Add this description: "A comprehensive machine learning system for detecting and recognizing sign language gestures in real-time using computer vision and deep learning."
   - Choose public or private repository (recommended: public)
   - Do NOT initialize with a README, .gitignore, or license (since we already have these files locally)
   - Click "Create repository"

2. **Push Your Local Repository to GitHub**
   - After creating the repository, GitHub will show commands to push an existing repository
   - Run these commands in your terminal:
   ```
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sign-language-detection-ml.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```
   - Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username

3. **Verify the Upload**
   - After pushing, refresh your GitHub repository page
   - You should see all your project files uploaded

4. **Additional GitHub Features to Consider Setting Up**
   - Add topics to your repository (e.g., "machine-learning", "sign-language", "computer-vision", "mediapipe")
   - Set up a GitHub Pages site from your repository settings (if you want to create a project website)
   - Enable Issues for bug tracking and feature requests
   - Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD if needed
